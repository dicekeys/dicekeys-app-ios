This project is currently copyright DiceKeys, LLC with all rights reserved while we choose a license.

We are choosing between the MIT license, under which we have already released our seeded crypto libraries, and a candidate "Right to Privacy" open source license that forbids the use of this code in such applications as stalkerware and government surveillance. We believe all software developers have an an obligation to consider whether they code they write -- including code intended to help protect people -- could have "dual uses" in applications that violate others' human rights. While we are unable to anticipate how any of our technologies are particularly valuable for violating others' rights, we cannot be certain they do not exist.

If you have thoughts on this choice, please contribute them either to the repository for the candidate license or by email us at license@dicekeys.com.

We apologize for the delay in choosing the license.

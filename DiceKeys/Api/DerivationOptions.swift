   * form earliest in the sort order) and "?" will be the third character
   * in each triple.

   * than letters and digits are. With this option on, should a user choose to manually
   * copy the contents of a DiceKey and make an error in copying an orientation, that
   * error will not prevent them from re-deriving the specified key or secret.
